What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It helps me better understand strings and pointers in C. It is interesting
how we can use both to implement the string functions. Overall, it was fun
and helpful at the same time because these are the basics and knowing them
makes programming in C more enjoyable.

I agree with this warning because every file should begin with a comment that
tells the reader what the program is all about. I adressed it and the warning
disappeared.
