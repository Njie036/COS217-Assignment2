assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information given
in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab in the file
~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.
The course's precepts.
The course's website.
The course's textbooks and reference manuals.
The man pages on the armlab cluster.
The course's current staff members outside of class time through office hours.
The course's current staff members outside of class time through meetings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It helps me better understand strings and pointers in C. It is interesting
how we can use both to implement the string functions. Overall, it was fun
and helpful at the same time because these are the basics and knowing them
makes programming in C more enjoyable.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

NA



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

armlab02:~/COS217-Assignment2$ critTer stra.c

Checking stra.c

   str.h: line 1: high priority: 
   A file should begin with a comment.

I agree with this warning because every file should begin with a comment that
tells the reader what the program is all about. I adressed it and the warning
disappeared. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

armlab02:~/COS217-Assignment2$ critTer strp.c

Checking strp.c

   strp.c: line 6: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pstr' in function definition differs from parameter name 'strArray' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 16: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'destOfCopy' in function definition differs from parameter name 'copiedArray' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 16: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pstr' in function definition differs from parameter name 'strArray' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 31: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'destOfConcat' in function definition differs from parameter name 'tobeConcat' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 31: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pstr' in function definition differs from parameter name 'strArray' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 43: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'toCompare' in function definition differs from parameter name 'strToCompare' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 43: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pstr' in function definition differs from parameter name 'strArray' in function declaration

I disagree with these warnings because I am using both arays and pointers to implement the same functions.
I used the array parameters instead of those of the pointers. For that reason,I can only use one of the two
in my str.h file. I think it makes more sense to give the stra.c file array names since I am dealing with arrays
and give strp.c pointer names since I am dealing with pointers.

What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

It is possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough because when these two functions are called, they check if there 
is space in the destination to copy or concatenate. If not, the program 
terminates.
